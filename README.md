## Whats new in R and ArcGIS

> Solving the worldâ€™s complex problems requires bringing together the best available tools, which often means integrating functionality between platforms. The R-ArcGIS Bridge establishes a seamless connection between the vetted spatial analysis powers of ArcGIS and the thousands of cutting-edge libraries for data science and statistical analysis in R. Come see this functionality in action and learn how you can incorporate the newest R-ArcGIS Bridge tools into your workflows.

## Spatial Data Science in ArcGIS Using Python and R

> Python and R are crucial in data science and provide powerful functionality that expands the capabilities of ArcGIS. This technical session will teach you how to integrate both open-source statistical packages with ArcGIS tools for spatial data science workflows. See how to take the guesswork out of transferring data between ArcGIS and the Python and R environments. The session will expect some knowledge of data manipulation in Python and R, as well as familiarity with running ArcPy geoprocessing tools.
